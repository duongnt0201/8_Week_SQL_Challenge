## üõ†Ô∏è Problem Statement

> Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they‚Äôve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

## üìÇ Dataset
Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:

### **```sales```**

<details>
<summary>
View table
</summary>

The sales table captures all ```customer_id``` level purchases with an corresponding ```order_date``` and ```product_id``` information for when and what menu items were ordered.

|customer_id|order_date|product_id|
|-----------|----------|----------|
|A          |2021-01-01|1         |
|A          |2021-01-01|2         |
|A          |2021-01-07|2         |
|A          |2021-01-10|3         |
|A          |2021-01-11|3         |
|A          |2021-01-11|3         |
|B          |2021-01-01|2         |
|B          |2021-01-02|2         |
|B          |2021-01-04|1         |
|B          |2021-01-11|1         |
|B          |2021-01-16|3         |
|B          |2021-02-01|3         |
|C          |2021-01-01|3         |
|C          |2021-01-01|3         |
|C          |2021-01-07|3         |

 </details>

### **```menu```**

<details>
<summary>
View table
</summary>

The menu table maps the ```product_id``` to the actual ```product_name``` and price of each menu item.

|product_id |product_name|price     |
|-----------|------------|----------|
|1          |sushi       |10        |
|2          |curry       |15        |
|3          |ramen       |12        |

</details>

### **```members```**

<details>
<summary>
View table
</summary>

The final members table captures the ```join_date``` when a ```customer_id``` joined the beta version of the Danny‚Äôs Diner loyalty program.

|customer_id|join_date |
|-----------|----------|
|A          |1/7/2021  |
|B          |1/9/2021  |

 </details>

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Case Study Questions

1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?
6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?

 <br /> 

## üöÄ Solutions

### **Q1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**
```sql
Select customer_id, 
	   sum(price) as Total_customer_spent
from sales sa
join menu me 
on sa.product_id=me.product_id
group by customer_id;
```

| customer_id | Total_customer_spent|
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 76          |
| B           | 74          |
| C           | 36          |


---

### **Q2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**
```sql
Select customer_id, 
	   count(distinct order_date) as DaysVisisted
from sales
group by customer_id;
```

|customer_id|DaysVisisted|
|-----------|------------|
|A          |4           |
|B          |6           |
|C          |2           |


---

### **Q3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?**

```sql
with subtable as(
	select customer_id,
			order_date,
            sa.product_id,
            product_name,
			row_number()  over (partition by customer_id order by order_date ASC) as rownum,
            rank()  over (partition by customer_id order by order_date ASC) as ranked
	from sales sa
    join menu me on sa.product_id = me.product_id
    )
Select customer_id, product_name
from subtable
-- where rownum = 1
where ranked = 1
;
```

**Result:**
when rownum = 1
| customer_id | product_name | 
| ----------- | ------------ | 
| A           | sushi        | 
| B           | curry        |

from sales sa
join menu me on sa.product_id=me.product_id
group by sa.product_id, product_name
order by count(sa.product_id) DESC
limit 1;
```

|product_id|product_name|Total_count|
|----------|------------|-----------|
|3         |ramen       |8          |

           count(sa.product_id) as TotalOrders,
		   rank() over (partition by customer_id order by count(sa.product_id) DESC) as ranked,
		   row_number() over (partition by customer_id order by count(sa.product_id) DESC) as rownum
	from sales sa
	join menu me on sa.product_id=me.product_id
